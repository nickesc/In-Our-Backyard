# In Our Backyard
A collection of products from the project *In Our Backyard*. Includes the text guide and the video.

In Our Backyard has two parts:

1. [Photogrammetry Video Instructions](https://nickesc.github.io/PhotogrammetryVideoInstructions)

3. [*In Our Backyard: a Generational Retrospective*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9Pu-3cldVE)

The project was a colaboration with my parents, where I asked them to select objects from our home
that made them think about me. The plan was to create point-cloud visualizations of those objects,
but in order to do that I needed captures of the objects. The easiest wa for them to do that was
through video capture, but no straightforward guides for that specific process existed, and I 
wasn't there to help them do it in person. So, I had to create [the guide](https://nickesc.github.io/PhotogrammetryVideoInstructions) for them. It contains 
thourough directions for how to select and capture an object with video for photogrammetry with
examples.

Once my parents had captured their objects using the guide for refernce, they sent their captures,
which I brought into Reality Capture and turned into point-clouds. Using [a Blender plugin](https://github.com/uhlik/bpy), I made 
the animation and rendered the video, and [*In Our Backyard: a Generational Retrospective*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9Pu-3cldVE) 
was ready.
